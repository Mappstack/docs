# Stackure Developer Documentation

This repository contains developer documentation for integrating applications with Stackure for authentication and access control.

These guides are intended for developers and technical administrators who are building or maintaining applications and want to make them available to users through Stackure.

## Start here

If you are integrating an application with Stackure, begin with:

- [`App Integration Guide`](app-integration/getting-started.md)

This guide walks you through registering your app, assigning access, and choosing an integration path.

## Integration paths

Once your app is registered, choose one of the following:

- [`SDK Integration (JavaScript / TypeScript)`](app-integration/sdk-js.md)

  The simplest way to add passwordless authentication, session validation, and role-based access using the Stackure SDK.

- [`Custom API Integration`](app-integration/api-integration.md)

  Direct REST API integration for full control over authentication and authorization flows.

## Scope

These documents focus on application integration only.

They do not cover:
- end-user behavior or UI flows
- Stackure console usage
- administrative or headless automation
- full API reference

Advanced and headless use cases are documented separately.
